"""
NOTE: there is often overlap between labels. However, you also often have 2 constraints
with the same overlapping labels eg. constraint_A = (lable_AS, label_IT) and constraint_B = (label_AS, label_IT).
Simply use your judgement to assign the best combination eg. constraint_A = (lable_AS) and constraint_B = (label_IT).

Try to use single labels as much as possible
